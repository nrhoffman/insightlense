# InsightLense

The InsightLense Chrome Extension is your own personal AI web assistant that has your safe consumption of knowledge
as it's top priority.

To Start: Ctrl+Q

It can provide:

1) Summarization of page content - Just click the summarize button in the sidebar

2) Chat Bot - Ask any questions you may have, specifically about the page content - or anything else!

The below features can be found in the right click options under the InsightLense menu.

3) Define - You can right click on highlighted text and define words or phrases.

4) Fact Check - After summarizing, you can right click on highlighted text and fact check.

5) Analyze - After summarizing, you can right click on highlighted text and analyze the content for various attributes,
   logical falacies, ulterior motives, and an overall analysis of the text. Be aware of propagandists, shady marketers,
   and other possible malicious content.

6) Rewrite - After summarizing, you can right click on highlighted text and have it rewritten removing bias, logical fallacy,
and propaganda. Additionally, there's an option to have the rewritten content be at a children's or college reading level.


Limitations:

1) The model is not completely up to speed on current events. If an event just occurred and the model is expected to give validity 
to the event rather than an analysis, there will be limitations.
E.g. If the election of 2024 just occurred, the model may get confused with the current election with previous elections.

2) Fact Check and Define have a limitation that can be relieved by first summarizing. Sometimes context is important to giving
an accurate Fact Check or Definition.
E.g. Are we defining an "Angel" of Hell's Angels or an "Angel" in a religious context?

3) With the rewrite API being bugged out of existance, the prompt API is currently being used for rewriting. Because it has not
been trained on explicit rewrites, there are some limitations.
