3. **Right-Click Context Menu**  
   Unlock additional tools with InsightLense’s context menu, available when you right-click on highlighted text. These options provide more in-depth insights and control over how you engage with the content:

   - **Fact Check**  
     Concerned about the accuracy of a statement? Highlight it and select **Fact-Check** to verify its truthfulness with a reliable source.

   - **Analyze**  
     Get a comprehensive breakdown of the highlighted text with **Analyze**. InsightLense evaluates the content for logical fallacies, bias, potential ulterior motives, and flags any malicious intent, ensuring you're aware of propagandists, marketers, and other questionable influences.

   - **Rewrite**  
     Need a clearer or more neutral version of the text? Select **Rewrite** to have the highlighted content rephrased to remove bias, logical fallacies, and propaganda.
